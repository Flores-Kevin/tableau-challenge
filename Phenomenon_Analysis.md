Phenomenon Analysis

-How many trips have been recorded in total during the chosen period?:
There was a total of 48,544 rides.

-By what percentage has total ridership grown?:
The total ridership has grown by a total of 106%.

-How have the proportions of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed?:
The proportions have not changed too dramatically. The majority of riders are subscription members throughout the entire observed time period.

-What are the peak hours when bikes are used during the summer months?:
The peak hours in April are 7:00am - 8:00am and 5:00pm - 6:00pm. With more activity throughout the day relative to the colder observed month of November. The main peak hours could suggest the riders are commuting to and from work.

-What are the peak hours when bikes are used during the winter months?:
The peak hours in November are 7:00am - 8:00am and 5:00pm - 6:00pm. The peak hours could suggest the riders are commuting to  and from work.

-What are the top and bottom 10 stations in the city for starting/ending a journey? Based on data, why do you hypothesize these are the top locations?:
The answer to which stations can be answered by looking at the graphs on the Tableau story. The why I hypothesize can be explained by the location of the stations. The data set I chose is based on the riders in New Jersey. The top most used stations are centered around where New Jersey meets Manhattan. Specifically where locals are most likely to use bikes to travel from New Jersey into Manhattan. The bottom ten stations are less centered around a specific area but are spread out deeper in New Jersey and areas further from the top ten most common stations. 

-How does the average trip duration change by age?:
The two longest trip averages were 23 and 73.

-What is the average distance in miles for a bike trip?:
The most common distance traveled was around half a mile. 

-Which bikes (by ID) are most likely due for repair or inspection in the timespan?:
26274 and 21916 were the two bikes with the most milage. However there are several others that are most likely due for repair.

-How variable is the utilization by bike ID?:
The variable is relatively low. This can be explained by where the bikes are stationed. If a bike is located in a top ten station it is more likely to have more milage. This would explain why most of the rides are performed by less than a quarter of the total bikes.
